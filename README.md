## Installation

To use HTML-To-Text in your Node.js project, you can install it via npm. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install html-to-text
```

This will download and install the HTML-To-Text library and its dependencies into your project's `node_modules` directory.

## Usage

Once you have installed HTML-To-Text, you can use it in your Node.js applications to convert HTML content to formatted text. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
const { htmlToText } = require('html-to-text');

const htmlContent = '<div>Nope Its not Ashton Kutcher. It is Kevin Malone. <p>Equally Smart and equally handsome</p></div>';

const formattedText = htmlToText(htmlContent, {
    wordwrap: 130
});

console.log(formattedText);
```

This code will output the following formatted text:

```
Nope Its not Ashton Kutcher. It is Kevin Malone.
Equally Smart and equally handsome
```

## Wordwrap Explanation

The `wordwrap` option in the `html-to-text` library specifies the maximum length of a line of text before it wraps to the next line. This is particularly useful for formatting text output to fit within a certain width, such as in terminal displays, emails, or printing.

In the example above, we've set `wordwrap: 130`, which means that each line of text generated from the HTML content will have a maximum length of 130 characters before it wraps to the next line. If a paragraph in the HTML content exceeds 130 characters in length, the `html-to-text` library will automatically insert line breaks to ensure that each line stays within the specified length limit.

You can adjust the `wordwrap` value according to your specific requirements and preferences.
